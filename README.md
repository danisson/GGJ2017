----
A simple 8-bit rhythm game, in which an unfortunate soccer fan tries to escape from the rival team's fans area without being noticed, while riding the (Mexican) wave with them and following the beat.
Press and hold the keyboard arrows to follow the coreography and try to keep up!

This game was made for 2017's Global Game Jam, our submission can be found [here](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/ol%C3%A9), you can also find it on the [Pico-8 BBS](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=28694) :smile:
